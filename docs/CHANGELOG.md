## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0.0

#### Configuration Changes
```python
# Old v1.x configuration
tool = ImpalaTransferTool(
    host='impala-host',
    database='default'
)

# New v2.0.0 configuration
tool = ImpalaTransferTool(
    source_host='impala-host',
    source_database='default',
    connection_type='impyla'
)
```

#### Method Changes
```python
# Old v1.x method
tool.transfer('my_table')

# New v2.0.0 method
tool.transfer_table('my_table')
# or
tool.transfer_query('SELECT * FROM my_table')
```

#### CLI Changes
```bash
# Old v1.x CLI
impala-transfer --host impala-host --table my_table

# New v2.0.0 CLI
impala-transfer --source-host impala-host --table my_table
